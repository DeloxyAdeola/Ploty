# Ploty
I used ploty.js which is a javascript visualization used to create web interaction. We created a dashboard that will allow users to explore the data from the Belly Button Biodiversity study. In the dashboard, user will select a test subject ID number the will aid the display of their information. D3 and Bootstrap was used to aid visualization.
